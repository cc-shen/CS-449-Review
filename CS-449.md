# CS 449 - Computer Human Interaction Final Exam Review

## What are the 6 steps of user-centered design?

1. Understand your users
2. Translate needs into functionalities
3. Create design ideas
4. Prototype design
5. Test & Evaluate
6. Build final version

**Mobile First Design**

1. Responsive Web Design (RWD)
    * enable web to fit to the screens of different devices automatically, displaying the content in a way that people feel comfortable
2. "Progressive Advancement" & "Graceful Degradation"
    * Advancement: first build a version for relatively lower browser which includes the most basic functions & features
    * Degradation: starts the product design from an advanced end to builds a version with well-rounded features at the beginning. Then make the product compatible to mobile ends by cutting some functions or contents

## What is the difference between UI and UX?

**UX** (invented by Don Norman): you **don't** know what to build so you **explore** & build **(new) functionalities**.

> 'User experience' encompasses all aspects of the end-user's interaction with the company, its services, and its products.

**UI**: you **know** what to build and you build a **nice and clear** interface.

> ...the series of screens, pages, and visual elements -- like buttons and icons -- that you use to interact with a device.

<details>
<summary><b>Differences from others</b></summary>

1. "UX is focused on the user’s journey to solve a problem, UI is focused on how a product’s surfaces look and function." - Ken Norton
2. "A UX designer is concerned with the conceptual aspects of the design process, leaving the UI designer to focus on the more tangible elements." - Andy Budd
3. "There is no difference between UX and UI design because they are two things that aren’t comparable to each other." - Craig Morrison
4. "UI is generally about visual design and information design around screens. UX is about the complete experience, and it may not be even about the screen." - Patrick Neeman
5. "UI is focused on the product, a series of snapshots in time. UX focuses on the user and their journey through the product." - Scott Jenson
6. "UX is the overall experience a user has with the product, and UI is the things the user will actually interact with and see." - Clayton Yan

## Is it possible to have a good UX but bad UI?

Yes, it's possible to provide a great structure, flow, and call to actions without a great interface design.

[Example](https://apple.ca)\
Landing page displaying single product at a single glance which is _not a creative and good looking UI_ but _able to captivate user’s focus_.\
Once you click on any product it redirects you to the product detail page which is once again _not a creative and design intensive_ however there is a proper panel for all important _call to action_ to provide the product details and Buy.

## What are the ethical considerations when conducting human subject experiments (ORE tutorial)?

* Respect for persons – Respect the autonomy, decision-making and dignity of participants.
* Beneficence – Minimizing the risks (physically, psychologically and socially) and maximizing the benefits to research participants.
* Justice – Participants should be selected from groups of people whom the research may benefit.
* Respect for communities – Protect and respect the values and interests of the community as a whole and protect the community from harm.

---

**Value Proposition**

> A promise of the value you can deliver; a sharp product definition that highlights the key aspects of it.

It should answer:

* What will you do
* Why you
* How will it help
* Who is it for

## What is the difference between user groups and personas?

**User Groups**

> A **general** description of your target user based on a set of statistically-driven characteristics.

Some demographics:

* Age & Gender
* Country & Language
* Education
* Occupation
* Residence
* Income
* Family status & size

Some other characteristics:

* Means of transportation
* Music preference
* Hobbies
* Food preferences
* Device preferences
* Fashion & clothing style
* Haircuts
* Sport preferences

**Persona**

> A **specific** description of target users based on fictional characters.

* A model of a user, focusing on his/her goals when using an artifact.
* Represents patterns of users' behaviour, goals, motivation
* Important for building empathy, communicating design goals and staying focused, and supporting decision-making

---

## What are considered good/bad interview questions and why?

Good questions:

* Neutral
* Avoids agree/disagree, yes/no, or true/false questions
* Asks for details
* Be specific

Bad questions:

* _Leading questions_
    * bias respondents into giving a certain answer by providing biasing content or suggesting information researcher is looking to confirm
* _Acquiescence bias_
    * people have tendencies to be agreeable (yes is more polite by social conventions)
* _Closed questions_
    * does not provide the person with the opportunity to describe their experience in rich detail
* _Broad questions_
    * lack focus and include items not clearly defined or can be interpreted in multiple ways
* _Double-barrelled questions_
    * ask about multiple items while only allowing for a single response
* _Hypothetical or prediction questions_
    * ask respondent to anticipate a future behaviour or attitude, resulting in biased and inaccurate response

---

## What is a "walkthrough" question in an interview?

A reconstruction of past events.\
It is concrete and grounded.

It can be any event.\
More recent the event, the better the walkthrough is: event still fresh in mind.

Details naturally emerge since it avoids abstract generalities that the person has to pre-filled.

### What is it useful for?

As the person performs a walkthrough, they provide details here and there about specific aspects of their experience.\
These markers are important to the person

* avoid imposing assumption of how a task is accomplished by them
* people _generally_ say things for a reason

We can use these markers to ask for more details.

---

## What habits should we avoid when interviewing?

* Go through a checklist of questions
* Ask short-answer, closed questions
* Leading questions that bias participants towards a particular answer
* Ask questions that encourage generalizations
* Interrupt the person
* Interview the person away from where their natural environment
* Shoehorn the person's words into your world-view, ignoring the specific terms they use and substituting your own
* Correct the person or attempt to teach them
* Don't look at the person
* Look like you don't want to be there

---

## What is the different between controlled and naturalistic observation?

**Controlled** (e.g., in a lab)

* easy to reproduce, analyze, conduct
* participants may change their behaviour if they are are aware that they are being watched

**Naturalistic** (e.g., home, workspace, street, bus, restaurant, etc.)

* more reliable and useful for ideation
* difficult to include a representative sample
* difficult to replicable
* difficult to explicitly manipulate variables

---

## When would we want to do observation versus interview?

---

**Affinity Diagram**

* a fast method for summarizing large amount of qualitative data
* notes are arranged into a hierarchy using a bottom-up process, where the categories are initially unknown
* _reveals common issues across all users_, not just one individual
* data reduction: hide rich details, look for the top findings

Steps:

1. Write down notes
    * literal
2. Categorize notes into labels representing an insight suggested by the notes
    * inferred user need
3. Categorize labels into key issues
    * summarizes multiple user needs
4. Categorize key issues into themes
    * high-level system concerns

## What is the difference between direct and participant observation?

**Direct**

* quantitative technique where observer is explicitly
    * counting the frequency/intensity of specific behaviour/events
    * mapping the social composition and action of a particular scene
* does not require any interaction between observer and participant
* type of data: how often, how many, how intensely, who was there

**Participant**

* qualitative, interactive and unstructured
* involves why questions, casual explanations, uncovering cognitive elements, rules and normals that underlie observable behaviours

### What data can be collected and how do we analyze observation data?

### What are the ethical considerations?

## What are Flow, Sequence, Cultural, Artifact, and Physical models?

**Flow**

* represents the communication and coordination necessary to accomplish a goal
* describes people's role/responsibility and how they communicate with each other
* includes:
    * interviewee (middle circle)
    * other groups/people (surrounding circles)
    * physical/virtual places (large rectangles)
    * artifacts as they pass between people (small rectangles)
    * breakdowns (lightning bolts)
    * flow (arrows)

**Sequence**

* work steps and intention behind steps
* includes:
    * _intent_ behind step
    * _triggers_ that initiate sequence
    * steps
    * loops and branches
    * breakdowns

**Cultural**

* captures external influences that may affect perception and adoption of the product
    * e.g., user's self image, constraints, values, formal and informal policy of an organization
* includes:
    * influencers (bubbles)
    * extent of influence (overlap of bubbles)
    * influences (arrows)
    * breakdowns (lightning bolts)

**Artifact**

* physical objects that support the work, that is created and/or used in the process
    * want to know what objects people need/interact with
* reveals how work is organized and user's conceptual distinctions
* includes:
    * drawing or photo
    * comments and notes on: structure, related purpose and functions, breakdown

**Physical**

* Physical Work Environment (Plan), complete with comments/notes
    * want to known how people adapt their environment for work
* representation of how the physical environment affects work
* includes:
    * structures that limit and define space
    * walls, desks, file cabinets, etc.
    * hardware, software, communication tools
    * artifacts and their location in relation to each other
    * movements of the user

# Even More Study Questions

## Review 1

A common problem for many people is that they forget whether
they have locked their door after leaving the house. It is not just
their door. Sometimes, they forget whether they have shut off the
water before leaving for Christmas holidays, whether they have
turn off the stove after cooking. You are an usability expert
consulting for a house insurance company called HouseSafe, who
wants to create a new app called "Forget Me Not" to help their
clients keep track of things that they are anxious about forgetting.

**Question**

1. The company wants you to jump straight into programming.
Describe to the company the 6 steps of the user-centered design
cycle and potential problems that may arise when a particular part
of the process is skipped.

## Review 2

The company sent you a persona to help ground your design:\
"The persona, Jody, is a 60 year old woman who lives alone. She
always boils water in a kettle for tea in the morning, but frequently
forgets to turn off the stove afterwards."

**Questions**

1. Is this a good persona description? Why or why not?
2. Define persona. How is persona different from user group? What are personas useful for?
3. What information do empathy maps capture? How are they different from personas?

## Review 3

As part of the exploratory study, you interviewed Bob:

> You: My first question is — It is typical that the older you get, the more forget you
> become. Do you consider yourself a forgetful person?
>
> Bob: I don’t think so… I mean… maybe …
>
> You: Ok, let me rephrase the question. Do you agree or disagree with the following
> statement: "I often forget whether I have turned off the stove and locked the door."
>
> Bob: I think I agree…
>
> You: OK, great!! If the app can automatically learn at what time you engage in certain
> types of activities, like boiling water, how much do you think you will like this feature?
>
> Bob: …

**Questions**

1. What is an exploratory study? Why is it an important first step in User Centered Design?
2. Describe all the mistakes you find in the interview and how you would fix these mistakes.
3. What is a "walkthrough" in an interview and how is it useful here?

## Review 4

In addition to the interview, you also want to collect some
quantitative data to inform your design of the "Forget Me Not"
app.

**Questions**

1. Give 3 examples of quantitative data you could collect from your target users.
2. What is the difference between quantitative and qualitative data? What benefits do they each provide?

## Review 5

You conducted an observation where you followed one of the
target users around for the day, and counted how many times she
checks and re-checks her stove. You also talked to the participant
throughout the day to understand her thought process and why
she is anxious about forgetting certain things.

**Questions**

1. What type of observation is this?
    * controlled or naturalistic?
    * non-participatory, passive participation, active participation, or complete participation?
    * direct observation or participant observation?
2. Why might we want to do observations instead of interviews?
3. You plan to create an affinity diagram to summarize the observation data. Describe the kinds of information that the affinity diagram should capture.

## Review 6

After conducting observational studies with multiple target users,
you notice that besides personal characteristics, many things can
affect whether someone forgets an important task. For example,
whether someone forgets to lock the door can depend on whether
the keys are visible and close by as he/she is leaving the house,
whether there is distraction (e.g., kids screaming for attention),
whether he/she is in a rush, and whether there is someone else
(e.g., spouse) that he/she depends on for remembering.

**Questions**

1. Name the work model that is the most appropriate here and explain why. Draw the work model containing the information provided above.
2. What are work models? What are their main purpose?
3. What are the 5 work models that we discussed in class? How are they different from each other?
4. What are consolidated work models?

## Review 7

After the exploratory study, it is time to design the functionalities of
the app.

**Questions**

1. Give 2 examples of _user story_ in the correct format.
2. What is the difference between a user story and a storyboard, in terms of the information that they contain?

## Review 8

As the final step of the process, you are iterating on your design
using both a low fidelity and high fidelity prototype. There are a lot
of evaluation techniques you can choose from, including:

* Wizard of Oz study
* Heuristic Evaluation
* Cognitive Walkthrough
* 5 Seconds Test
* Tree Testing
* A/B Testing
* Click Testing
* Keystroke Level modeling
* Eye tracking
* Focus Group

**Questions**

What technique would you use for the following scenario and why?

1. To see whether users can find the "settings"
2. To evaluate whether the app appears professional and trustworthy
3. To understand the extent to which users can successful create reminders for certain tasks (e.g., lock the door)
4. To compare the time it takes users to turn off the alarm when the button is green versus red.

## Review 9

The "Forget Me Not" app allows users to schedule important task
(e.g., "Lock the Door", "Turn off Stove"), and the app reminds users
to complete the task by sending a ring tone or vibration.

**Questions**

1. Draw a basic sketch of the "Forget me Not" app interface to illustrate various principles of visual design, including the Von Restoff Effect and Gestalt Principles (Proximity, Similarity, Closure, Continuity, Figure/Ground).
2. Why are colour choices and shape choices important in design?

## Review 10

The target user groups of the "Forget Me Not" app will mostly be
consisted of senior citizens.

**Questions**

1. How might your attitude and design approach be different if you are adopting _universal design_ versus _ability-based design_ as your guiding principle?
2. What is the difference between game and gamification? Describe one way you can gamify the app to motivate senior citizens to use it.
